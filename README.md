Soil Moisture Calculation Test for YL69 Soil Moisture Sensor using Arduino Uno R3

It displays the recorded Sensor Value and shows the mathematical computation needed to compute the Moisture Percentage using C++ for Arduino IDE.

# ðŸ’§ Description 

The code reads data from a soil moisture sensor connected to analog pin A0 and calculates the soil moisture percentage.
 
- `#define SENSOR_PIN A0` : This line defines a preprocessor macro, assigning the name Â SENSOR_PINÂ  to analog pin A0 for better code readability.

- Â `const int WET_VALUE = 300;Â  and Â const int DRY_VALUE = 1024;` :  declare constants representing the sensor's readings for completely wet and dry soil, respectively.  These values are crucial for calibration and need to be determined experimentally for specific sensor and soil conditions.  Note that Â DRY_VALUEÂ  is set to 1024, the maximum reading of a 10-bit ADC.

- Â `void loop() { ... }`Â : This function continuously reads the sensor value using Â analogRead(A0)Â , calculates the moisture percentage using a linear interpolation formula: Â ((sensorValue - DRY_VALUE) / (WET_VALUE - DRY_VALUE)) * 100Â , and prints both the raw sensor value and calculated percentage to the serial monitor. The Â delay(1000)Â  function adds a one-second pause between readings.
 
# ðŸ«§ Considerations
 
- The accuracy of the moisture percentage depends on the correct calibration of Â WET_VALUEÂ  and Â DRY_VALUEÂ .  
- The calculation assumes a linear relationship between the sensor reading and soil moisture. 
- The code assumes a sensor where higher values indicate drier soil.
